# Orton Gillingham Tutoring

I provide a warm and welcome learning environment for students who struggle with reading and spelling to "take chances, make mistakes" and have some fun. I am a kind and caring tutor who is extremely sensitive to students emotional needs. I specialize in working with children aged 7-12, and parents tell me that their children really enjoy coming to my classes.

## About Me

<img style="float: right" src="assets/images/lori.jpg" width="150"/>

My name is Lori Ferg, and I am very passionate about tutoring and helping students. I am proud to be a BC Certified teacher, and I have been tutoring  in the Lower Mainland for over 27 years. Throughout this time, I have worked with over 100 elementary and secondary students from many cultural backgrounds and abilities. In addition to my degrees in Education and English Literature, I have completed my training and practicum in the Orton Gillingham approach to learning.


## Orton Gillingham Tutoring: $85/hour


The Orton Gillingham approach gives the student the opportunity to learn how to read and spell in a way that differs from the typical public school method. With this approach, the student learns how to match the letters of the alphabet into predictable sounds. This manner of instruction encourages the student to learn with his or her eyes, ears and fingers. This is know as VAKT or multisensory learning. 
 
The approach is intensive, sequential and phonic-based, and it teaches the basics of word formation before whole word meaning. The Orton Gillingham method encourages and utilizes four learning modalities, or pathways, through which children can learn: visual, auditory, kinesthetic and tactile. Perhaps the most valuable aspect of this approach is that it allows for flexibility and individualization. Each child learns differently; therefore, each lesson is tailored for that specific child’s needs. 
 
In addition, the Orton Gillingham approach is direct, explicit, and cumulative. As each new sound and symbol is learned, the practitioner threads the known into the next level of learning. The Orton Gillingham approach is success oriented thus bringing the student up to grade level reading and writing. 
 
Each Orton Gillingham lesson is individualized. I usually spend an hour’s worth of preparation before even giving the lesson, so rates for this form of instruction are higher than for standard English classes.
​
Expect an 18 to 36 month commitment to bring your child up to grade level learning.

> "Lori is a gem, so wonderful with my daughter, who even looks forward to the tutoring sessions (even on Friday nights. . .) She boosts her confidence, has really good homework materials, is very encouraging and while my daughter only had 67% on her last report card, she now has 81% (which is exceptional for her.")

> "Lori Ferg tutored my ESL granddaughter in English at Grade 4 level for six months... She did excellent work. The student looked forward to and enjoyed each visit. Her confidence in English and her school marks improved over all, and have remained good in Grade 5. She now reads lots of library books for pleasure."
